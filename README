    -- About --

    The Scala Community Library (Scalax) is a nascent project to develop a
    general utility library for the Scala language, as a companion to the
    standard library.  All members of the Scala community are invited to
    participate, by contributing code and by reviewing existing contributions.
    Scalax is released under a BSD-style license, the same as Scala itself.

    Please see http://scalax.scalaforge.org/ for more information.


    -- Compiling --

    Scalax depends only on the Scala compiler (latest stable release).  A
    Makefile and Ant project are both provided.

    To build using Ant, you will need to supply the location of your Scala
    installation, e.g.:

      ant -Dscala.home=/opt/scala
